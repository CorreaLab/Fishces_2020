# Fishces_2020
This repository contains the code associated with analyses of the density and community composition of Symbiodiniaceae in fish feces.

#Symiodiniaceae cell counts (figure 2).
This code contains everything needed to replicate the analysis for Symbiodiniaceae cell counts. The data can be found attached to the manuscript. DOI:

#Symbiodiniaceae community analysis (figure 3).
This code contains everything needed to replicate the analysis for Symbiodiniaceae community analysis. 
You will need the following files (that are also in the Fishces_2020 folder: 
- Fishces_2019_ITS2_2_profiles.csv #This file contains output from Symportal, but all the individual ITS2 profiles are removed.
- Fishces_ 2019_ITS2_2_profiles_meta.csv #This file contains clade information from the output from Symportal.
- Sample_map.csv #This file contains data on individual samples included in the analysis (e.g. species names and collection zones)
- specode.csv #this file contains a string of names used in one of the figures
- Sym_gen.csv #This file contains Symbiodiniaceae genera names to be used in one of the figures (instead of clade denominations)

#Dispersal rate estimates (figure 4).
This code contains everything needed to replicate the bootstrap analysis used for figure 4. The data can be found attached to the manuscript. DOI:
